-- 1. Create the 'avatars' bucket if it doesn't exist
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('avatars', 'avatars', true)
on conflict (id) do nothing;

-- 2. Set up security policies for the 'avatars' bucket

-- Allow public access to view images (SELECT)
create policy "Avatar images are publicly accessible."
  on storage.objects for select
  using ( bucket_id = 'avatars' );

-- Allow authenticated users to upload images (INSERT)
create policy "Anyone can upload an avatar."
  on storage.objects for insert
  with check ( bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated' );

-- Allow users to update their own images (UPDATE) - Optional, often handled by re-upload/overwrite logic
create policy "Anyone can update their own avatar."
  on storage.objects for update
  using ( bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid() = owner )
  with check ( bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid() = owner );
